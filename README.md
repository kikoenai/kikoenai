- 👋 Hi, I’m @kikoenai!
- 👀 I’m interested in open source solutions for the home.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. I'm guessing most projects will either use python or javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that allows for open source and allows me to make use of old hardware for mordern jobs
- 📫 How to reach me: github
